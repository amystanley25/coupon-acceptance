***Key Findings***

**Bar Coupon Findings:**
The analysis of bar coupons revealed that approximately 41 percent of recipients accepted the offer. Frequency of bar visits played a significant role because users who frequent bars more than three times a month were notably more likely to accept these coupons. Age and lifestyle factors also influenced acceptance rates as bar-goers over 25 years old who go out regularly showed an acceptance rate of around 55 percent. Passenger presence mattered as well since drivers without kids in the car, particularly when accompanied by friends or partners, were more inclined to use the coupons. Additionally, users employed in occupations outside of agriculture or fishing were more responsive to bar coupons. Certain segmented groups stood out with higher acceptance rates including frequent bar-goers who are not widowed and traveling without kids, younger frequent bar-goers under 30, and frequent visitors of inexpensive restaurants earning less than fifty thousand dollars annually. Based on these findings, it appears drivers are more likely to accept bar coupons in social settings during non-urgent trips and when the coupon has a longer validity period. Factors such as time of day especially afternoon and evening and favorable weather conditions also correlated with increased acceptance rates.

**Coffee Coupon Findings:**
Out of all drivers who received this coupon, the overall acceptance rate was 51%, indicating moderate interest. When analyzing passenger type, we found that those traveling with friends had the highest acceptance rate at 53%, followed by those traveling alone or with kids at 50% each. To assess whether coffee-drinking habits influenced behavior, we quantified visit frequency and discovered that drivers who go to coffee houses more than once a month had a noticeably higher acceptance rate. We then identified a "power user" groupâ€”drivers who frequently visit coffee shops, were not with kids, and received the coupon at 10AM. This group exhibited an elevated acceptance rate of 67%, suggesting that targeting socially-active, frequent coffee drinkers during morning hours may significantly boost coupon effectiveness.
